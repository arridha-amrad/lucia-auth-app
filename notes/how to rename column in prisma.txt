How to rename a column with Prisma migrations
Edit the name of your column in your schema.prisma file.

Run prisma migrate dev --create-only. This will generate the SQL migration file, but will not immediately run it.

You’ll be prompted with a warning that you’re about to drop a column. This is ok because we’ll manually fix the migration. Type y to proceed.

You’ll be prompted to enter a name for your migration.

Open the newly generated migration.sql file in the prisma/migrations directory. Notice that it drops the original column and creates a whole new column. We don’t want this, since it will delete all existing data in that column. The generated SQL should look something like this:

-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "MyTable" DROP COLUMN "oldName",
ADD COLUMN "newName" INTEGER;
Edit the SQL query to simply rename the table, like this:

ALTER TABLE "MyTable" RENAME COLUMN "oldName" TO "newName";
Run prisma migrate dev to run your modified migration.
